--

2007.02.02  v0.7

* Ported to GTK+ 2.4.
* Removed the [Weights&Measures] and [Temperatures] toggle buttons which were 
  used to select the current mode, and added 3 callbacks to set the mode 
  depending on which of the 3 entry fields is edited.
* In the on_editdlg_btn_ok_clicked() callback, added some code to make the 
  newly-added conversion the current one.
* Added a [Delete] button to the "Edit/Add" dialog, and added 2 callbacks to 
  disable the button if the Unit1 or Unit2 entry is edited (in which case, it's 
  assumed that the user wants to add a conversion).

2007.01.18  v0.6

* Removed all calls to GNOME library functions to reduce dependencies.  This 
  version uses GTK+ 1.2 as the sole GUI toolkit.
* Removed code to automatically write a configuration file on startup.  In 
  v0.5, a config file is automatically written if it doesn't already exist.  
  This version only writes a config file if weights&measures are edited or 
  added.  Also, since this version doesn't use the GNOME devlib, the config 
  file is now named ~/.gmeasures.cfg instead of ~/.gnome/gMeasures.
* Added some documentation.

2002.03.26	v0.5

????.??.??	previous versions

* The origin of this program dates back to sometime around 1994-1995.  It was 
  originally a built-in feature of a larger project called BFW (BinFiler for 
  Windows).  The first standalone versions for GNU/Linux were written sometime 
  between 2000 and 2002.
